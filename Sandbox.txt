name: ACI Simulator Reservation
description: The ACI Sandbox provides a developer with an environment to design, develop and test using the ACI RESTful APIs over http/https with XML and JSON encodings.  OpFlex, the southbound API, is an open and extensible protocol used to transfer policy in XML/JSON between Cisco APIC, and the device in the sample network topology.  The central SDN Controller of the ACI solution, the Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) manages and configures the policy on each of the switches in the ACI fabric.  Cisco APIC is a unified point for policy-based configuration expressed through group-based policy. The primary function of Cisco APIC is to provide policy authority and policy resolution mechanisms for the Cisco ACI fabric and devices attached to the fabric. Automation is provided as a direct result of policy resolution and renders its effects on the Cisco ACI fabric, so that end users no longer have to touch each network element and manually make sure that all policies are configured appropriately.

name: TRex
description: Traditionally, routers have been tested using commercial traffic generators and performance has been measured using packets per second (PPS) metrics. As router functionality and services have become more complex, stateful traffic generators have become necessary to provide more realistic application traffic scenarios.
